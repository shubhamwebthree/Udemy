sCrypt Overview
sCrypt is an embedded Domain Specific Language (eDSL) based on TypeScript for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin SV. Embedded means that it is a language inside another language. sCrypt is strictly a subset of TypeScript, so all sCrypt code is valid TypeScript, but 
not vice versa.

How do Bitcoin Smart Contracts work?
Smart contracts on Bitcoin are based on the UTXO model, which is very different from an account model like Ethereum used.

UTXO model :-
Each bitcoin transaction consists of some inputs and outputs. An output contains:

The amount of bitcoins it contains.
bytecodes (called the locking script).
while an input contains:

A reference to the previous transaction output.
bytecodes (the unlocking script).
An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is an output not consumed in any transaction yet. The low-level bytecode/opcode is called Bitcoin Script, which is interpreted by the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM).

scrypt-cli CLI
scrypt-cli is a CLI tool that makes sCrypt development faster and easier.

Let us use scrypt-cli to create a project:
